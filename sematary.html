                    <div class="thumbnail center">Sematary is an up and coming rapper from Northen California who has managed to break out of any possible characterization or boxes he could possibly be placed in.
                        Coming onto the scene in 2019 with his collaborative mixtape with fellow rapper and best friend, Ghost Mountain, he has since evolved into an artist revered for his mashups of unlikely genre combinations.
                        Currently, Sematary has experimented with black metal infused hip hop in his rainbow bridge trilogy, witch house in his two collaborations with Ghost Mountain, and rap over punk guitar riffs in his Warboy EP.
                        Going from 300 monthly listeners to 13,000 in less then a year, Sematary shows no signs of slowing down, and is likely going to be the next big name in the underground.</div>
